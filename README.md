**Where financial growth meets the thrill of the win. We are turning passive savings into an active, rewarding experience you can't lose.**

***

## 💭 The Problem: The Saver's Dilemma

Trillions of dollars sit in traditional savings accounts, eroded by inflation and earning negligible interest. It's safe, but it's a losing game. On the other end of the spectrum, billions are spent on lotteries, chasing life-changing wins but almost always resulting in a total loss of capital.

This creates a massive dilemma for everyday people:
* **The Safe Path:** Earn virtually nothing on your savings.
* **The Risky Path:** Gamble your savings for a shot at high rewards.

This is the market gap. People want the security of savings combined with the excitement and upside of a lottery, without the risk of loss.

***

## 🚀 Our Solution: The AI-Powered, No-Loss Savings Game

**Prize Savings** is the first AI-managed, prize-linked savings protocol on Etherlink. We've created a **positive-sum game** where users can't lose. By depositing funds, you are not only saving your money securely but also automatically entering a weekly draw to win the entire prize pool generated from the collective yield.

Think of us as an **intelligent, gamified bank account**. Your money is always safe, always yours, but now it also gives you a weekly shot at a better financial future.

### How It Works in 4 Simple Steps

| Step                | Action                                                                                                                     | Technical Implementation                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Deposit & Pool** | Users deposit USDC into a single, secure, non-custodial smart contract vault on Etherlink.                                      | Users interact with the React frontend, which calls the `deposit()` function on the `Vault.sol` contract.                                                      |
| **2. AI Generates Prize** | Our AI agent simulates yield generation, creating and funding the weekly prize pool.                                         | The agent's backend calls `simulate_yield_harvest_and_deposit()`, which mints MockUSDC and deposits it into the `EtherlinkVrfYieldStrategy.sol` contract.               |
| **3. Provably Fair Draw** | The agent triggers the weekly lottery, using **Etherlink's Native VRF** for a cryptographically secure and random winner selection. | The agent calls `trigger_lottery_draw()`, which executes the `harvestStrategy()` function on the `Vault.sol` contract, initiating the VRF draw in the strategy. |
| **4. Win or Save** | One lucky winner receives the entire prize pool. Everyone else keeps 100% of their initial deposit.                      | The `EtherlinkVrfYieldStrategy` contract automatically transfers the prize to the winner's address. All other users' shares in the `Vault` remain untouched.        |

## 🏛️ The Philosophy: Why A "Positive-Sum Game"?

Finance is too often a zero-sum game. Lotteries are a *negative-sum* game by design. **Etherlink Prize Savings** is built on the principle of a **positive-sum game**:

* **The Winner:** Receives a prize far greater than they could have earned alone.
* **The Participants:** Lose nothing. Their savings remain intact and they benefit from a fun, engaging experience.
* **The Ecosystem:** Grows as more users are onboarded to a safe, compelling Web3 product, increasing overall liquidity and activity on Etherlink.

This philosophy is embodied by our AI agent: it works for the collective good, optimizing the prize potential while guaranteeing the safety of the individual's capital.

## 🔑 Key Features & Technical Innovation

We've built a sophisticated system that blends cutting-edge AI with robust blockchain security.

### 🏦 No-Loss Savings Vault & ERC4626 Architecture
* **What it is:** Your principal deposit is always safe. Only the generated yield is contributed to the prize pool.
* **Technical Detail:** Our `Vault.sol` contract is designed based on the principles of the **ERC4626 Tokenized Vault Standard**. This ensures a clear separation between user deposits (represented as shares) and the yield-generating strategies, making it impossible for the prize mechanism to touch user principal.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Autonomous Agent
* **What it is:** The protocol is managed by a sophisticated backend agent that handles all operations, from funding the prize pool to triggering draws and assessing risk.
* **Technical Detail:** The agent is built in Python using **FastAPI** for the server, **LangChain** for structuring LLM interactions, and **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini** as the reasoning engine. It can interpret high-level commands (e.g., "run the weekly lottery cycle") and execute a multi-step, on-chain plan. This grounds intelligent automation in a transparent, verifiable system.

### 🎲 Provably Fair Lottery with Etherlink Native VRF
* **What it is:** We use Etherlink's built-in Verifiable Random Function for cryptographically secure and auditable randomness, ensuring every lottery draw is transparent and fair.
* **Technical Detail:** Our `EtherlinkVrfYieldStrategy.sol` contract directly integrates with Etherlink's native VRF contract at `0x0000000000000000000000010000000000000001`. This avoids reliance on external oracles, providing a higher level of security and decentralization.

### 📊 ML-Driven Risk Management
* **What it is:** The agent uses a machine learning model to assess the risk of potential DeFi strategies before deploying capital.
* **Technical Detail:** The agent loads a pre-trained `.joblib` anomaly detection model. The `assess_strategy_risk()` tool can analyze a strategy's on-chain metrics (if on Ethereum) to generate a risk score, preventing the agent from allocating funds to high-risk protocols.

### 🔗 FCL & EVM Dual-Compatibility
* **What it is:** A seamless user experience for everyone, whether they use a native Etherlink wallet or a standard EVM wallet like MetaMask.
* **Technical Detail:** Our React frontend uses `wagmi` for EVM wallet connections and `@onEtherlink/fcl` for native Etherlink integration. We've built custom hooks (`useFCLStatus`) to detect the user's connection type and provide a tailored UI, showcasing the power of Etherlink's EVM compatibility.

## 🔬 Under the Hood: A Modular & Scalable Contract Framework

While the current testnet deployment uses a focused set of contracts to power the core prize-savings game, we have built a comprehensive and modular smart contract system designed for rapid, secure expansion. This architecture is the foundation for our long-term vision and is ready for future deployment.

This forward-thinking framework includes several key components:

### 1. The `VaultFactory.sol`
* **Purpose:** This factory contract is designed to deploy new, isolated `Vault` instances permissionlessly.
* **Vision:** This enables the creation of a multi-vault ecosystem where different communities, or even individuals, can launch their own prize-savings games with unique assets or configurations, all managed by our AI agent framework.

### 2. Pluggable Yield Strategies (`Strategies.sol`)
* **Purpose:** We've designed a generic strategy interface that can interact with any external DeFi protocol simply by defining its function selectors.
* **Vision:** This makes our system incredibly adaptable. Integrating a new yield source becomes a simple matter of deploying a new strategy adapter, not re-writing the core vault logic. To prove this model, we have already built production-ready implementations for major protocols:
    * **`AaveV3Strategy.sol`**: A complete strategy for earning yield on Aave.
    * **`CompoundV3Strategy.sol`**: A complete strategy for earning yield on Compound.

### 3. User Experience & Automation Contracts
* **`AutoDepositProxy.sol`**: This helper contract is designed to enhance user experience by allowing for one-click deposits. For example, funds bridged from another chain can be sent directly to this proxy, which then automatically deposits them into the vault on behalf of the user, saving gas and steps.

This modular design is what allows our **Future Roadmap** to be so ambitious. The foundation is already built to support real multi-protocol and multi-chain yield generation in a secure and scalable way.

## 💰 Business Model & Go-To-Market

Our revenue model is simple, transparent, and fully aligned with our users' success.

* **Primary Revenue Stream: Performance Fee**
    * We will take a small percentage (e.g., 10%) of the **generated yield only**.
    * **Example:** If the prize pool for a week is $1,000, the winner receives $900 and the protocol receives $100 to fund operations and growth.
    * **The Guarantee:** If there is no yield, there are no fees. We only earn when our users win.

### Go-To-Market Strategy
* **Phase 1: Launch on Etherlink Testnet & Build Community (Current)**
    * Engage with the Etherlink community through social media, developer forums, and hackathons.
    * Gather user feedback to refine the product and user experience.
* **Phase 2: Mainnet Launch with Real Yield Strategies**
    * Integrate with audited, blue-chip protocols on Etherlink (e.g., Increment Finance) to generate real yield.
    * Launch a marketing campaign focused on the "no-loss" value proposition to attract initial liquidity.
* **Phase 3: Scale & Expand**
    * Introduce new features like premium prize tiers, team-based savings games, and NFT-based rewards.
    * Explore multi-chain yield optimization, using the AI agent to find the best risk-adjusted returns across the entire Web3 ecosystem.

***

## 🗺️ Future Development & Roadmap

This project provides a robust foundation. The next phase will focus on transitioning from a simulated environment to a live, fully autonomous, yield-bearing protocol.

* **Implement Real Yield Strategies on Etherlink:**
    * Integrate with established Etherlink protocols like **Increment Finance** or **Etherlinkswap** to generate real yield from user deposits.
    * Develop and deploy new Cadence-based yield strategies to leverage Etherlink's unique capabilities for gas efficiency and composability.
* **Enhance the ML Risk Model:**
    * Train the risk assessment model on historical data from actual Etherlink DeFi protocols.
    * Build a data pipeline to continuously fetch on-chain data to keep the model updated and relevant.
    * Allow the agent to dynamically retrain the model based on new information and market conditions.
* **Expand Agent's Autonomous Capabilities:**
    * Enable the agent to autonomously decide *when* and *how much* capital to allocate to different strategies based on risk/reward calculations.
    * Implement logic for the agent to automatically rebalance the portfolio if a strategy's risk profile changes.
    * Use **Account Linking** on Etherlink to allow the agent to securely manage vault operations with clear permissions and user-controlled recovery mechanisms, creating a truly secure autonomous system.
* **UX Enhancements with Cadence:**
    * Leverage Cadence to introduce features impossible on traditional EVM chains, such as **sponsored/batched transactions** for a gasless user experience and **walletless onboarding** for mainstream adoption.

## ❓ Addressing Key Questions (FAQ)

#### "Is this just another lottery?"
No. It's a savings protocol first. Traditional lotteries require you to spend and lose your money for a chance to win. With us, your deposit is never spent. You are essentially getting a free lottery ticket every week, just for saving your money. The prize is created from the *yield*, not the principal.

#### "If I don't win, do I lose anything?"
Absolutely not. This is the core of our "no-loss" guarantee. If you don't win, your initial deposit remains untouched and is available for you to withdraw at any time.

#### "Is my money safe?"
Security is our highest priority.
1.  **Non-Custodial:** You always maintain full ownership of your funds. We can never access your deposited principal.
2.  **No-Loss Guarantee:** The smart contracts are architected to ensure only generated yield is moved to the prize pool. Your deposit is isolated and safe.
3.  **Future-Proofing:** When real yield strategies are implemented, they will be restricted to a whitelist of heavily audited, battle-tested protocols, and our AI will continuously monitor for risks.
